## I. Overview

This script runs linear mixed models testing for trends in density and taxonomic richness over time at the site-level and ecoregion-level. Models are designed after Rumschlag et al. - relevant variables of interest in their analyses were:


    * Proportion of specimen ID'd (labsplit*fieldsplit)
    
    * Proportion of specimen w/in sample ID'd to genus
    
    * Sample Area
    
    * Year (as non-integer)
    
    * Ecoregion
    
    * Ecoregion * Year
    
    * Random intercept for site
