## Cleaned datafile info

This document provides background info on each of the cleaned datasets in the "cleaned_data" folder. 

### Dataset Info: 

  1. **sample_richness_noCorrections.csv** - this file has sample metadata along with a column for taxonomic richness and total abundance for **all unique sample ID's**. No corrections have been made to account for differences in sampling method, sampling habitat, or sampling agency. All lifestages are included, as are samples classified to all taxonomic levels. All samples with a lab split of < 0.055 have been removed. 
  
  2. **site_5day_richness.csv** - this file has sample metadata along with taxonomic richness and total abundance for each site, with replicates (considered to be any samples collected within 5 days of each other) combined to calculate mean richness & abundance across these "replicates." No corrections have been made to account for differences in sampling method, sampling habitat, or sampling agency. All lifestages are included, as are samples classified to all taxonomic levels. All samples with a lab split of < 0.055 have been removed. 
  
  3. **site_year_richness.csv** - has sample metadata plus mean taxonomic richness and total abundance for each year at each site. No corrections have been made to account for differences in sampling method, sampling habitat, or sampling agency. All lifestages are included, as are samples classified to all taxonomic levels. All samples with a lab split of < 0.055 have been
